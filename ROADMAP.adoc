= ECOSYSTEM.scm Roadmap

== Current Status

ECOSYSTEM.scm is stabilized; the MVP v1.1 release (January 2026) provides the canonical
schema, badge guidance, and release artifacts for handover. Engineering focus will now
shift to supporting downstream integration points with new projects (see IO priorities).

== Milestones

=== v0.1.0 - Foundation
* [x] Core functionality
* [x] Basic documentation
* [x] CI/CD pipeline

=== v1.0.0 - Initial Release
* [x] Full feature set
* [x] Comprehensive tests
* [x] Production ready

=== v1.1 - MVP Continuity
* [x] Package release bundle `mvp-v1.1-release.tar.gz`
* [x] Publish GitHub release `v1.1` with audit README + signature metadata
* [x] Document handover status for IO and downstream teams

== Future Directions

* Track integration feedback from IO and other adopters; log issues in the `issue-tracker/` workspace.
* Prepare a follow-on release (v2.0) focused on conformance test harnesses and richer badge automation.
